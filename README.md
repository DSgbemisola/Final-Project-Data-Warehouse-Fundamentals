# Introduction

This comprehensive project is designed to provide hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and querying a data warehouse using PostgreSQL. 

It simulates a real-world scenario where you, as a data engineer, assist a waste management company in Brazil in managing and analyzing their solid waste collection data. 

The project involves multiple stages, from designing and creating a star schema for the data warehouse, loading data, writing complex SQL queries for data aggregation, and creating materialized view for query optimization.

# Highlights

The project offers a multitude of learning benefits, particularly for those seeking to enhance their data engineering and business intelligence skills:

Practical experience in data warehouse design: It provides hands-on experience in designing and implementing a star schema, which is crucial for any data warehousing project.

SQL Query writing skills: Enhances your ability to write complex SQL queries, including grouping sets, rollups, and cubes, essential for data analysis and reporting.

Data loading and transformation: Offers practice in data loading and transformation, an essential skill for managing data warehouses.

Real-world scenario applications: The scenario-based approach of the lab ensures that the skills acquired are relevant and applicable in real-world data warehousing and business intelligence projects.

Career advancement: These skills are in high demand in the fields of data engineering, business intelligence, and analytics, contributing significantly to professional growth and opportunities.

This project serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone aiming to strengthen their expertise in data warehousing and business intelligence, providing practical skills that are directly applicable in professional environments.

# Software used in the lab

In this project, I used PostgreSQL Database. PostgreSQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) designed to store, manipulate, and retrieve data efficiently.

# Scenario

You are a data engineer hired by a solid waste management company. It collects and recycles solid waste across major cities in the country of Brazil. 

They operate hundreds of trucks of different types to collect and transport solid waste. 

The company would like to create a data warehouse so that it can create reports like:

Total waste collected per year per city
Total waste collected per month per city
Total waste collected per quarter per city
Total waste collected per year per trucktype
Total waste collected per trucktype per city
Total waste collected per trucktype per station per city
You will use your data warehousing skills to design and implement a data warehouse for the company.

# Learning objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to:

Design a data warehouse.
Load data into the data warehouse.
Create a materialized view.

# About the data set

The data set usesd in this project is not a real-life data set. It was programmatically created for this assignment purpose.

# Phase 1: Design a data warehouse

The solid waste management company has provided the sample data they want to collect.
